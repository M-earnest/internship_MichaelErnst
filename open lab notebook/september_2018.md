- ansl: overhauling and adapting "aint_no_sound_loud_enough" exp
      * adding gui for easy access of runs
      * cleaning up and adapting PEP8
      * removed unnecessary global declarations
      * changed stimuli calls to relative paths and changed folder structure
      * exchanged if-statement structure, which previously was used to differ between settings, to function statements
        -> simplifying structure into either one function for each setting or writing general function, which simply
           takes setting as keyword for saving
      * changed range of for loop to (0, 14), instead of (0, 13)
           
- updating distro to 18.04, including complete system overhaul
